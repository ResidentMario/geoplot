## Cloning

To work on `geoplot` locally, you will need to clone it.

```git
git clone https://github.com/ResidentMario/geoplot.git
```

You can then set up your own branch version of the code, and
 work on your changes for a pull request from there.

```bash
cd geoplot
git checkout -B new-branch-name
```



## Environment

`geoplot` depends on one set of requirements for installation and usage, and another (augmented) set of requirements 
for development. Both require [`conda`](https://conda.io/) to work. The easiest way to get a development environment 
set up is to run `conda install --file devenv.yml` out of the `envs` directory.

This should install all necessary dependencies. If it fails, you will need to localize a few yourself. Use the 
packages listed in `devenv.yml` as a guide.

Due to the outstanding issue mentioned in the `README`, `geoplot` does not work on Windows. Sorry.

## Testing

`geoplot` tests are located in the `tests` folder. Any PRs you submit should eventually pass all of the tests located
 in this folder, or fail them for very good reasons.

Tests are in a somewhat inconsistent state right now, as they are going through refactoring.

## Documentation

Documentation is provided via `sphinx`, plus a handful of plug-ins.

In general, to regenerate the documentation from the current source, navigate to the `docs` folder and run `make html`.

### Reference images
The API reference images are generated from the thusly named Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks` folder. You can 
regenerate these images by running all or part of this notebook. That means that editing these pages is a two-step 
process: edit and save the notebooks, then run `make html` to finally generate the HTML.

### Gallery images
The Gallery images are generated from Python scripts in the `docs/examples` subfolder. All of the examples are 
self-contained and you should be able to regenerate them by running them at the command line.

### Tutorial

TODO.

### Everything else
The remaining pages are all written as `rst` files accessible from the top level of the `docs` folder. For these, 
just `make html` will suffice.

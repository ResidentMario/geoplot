Installation
============

`conda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/>`_ is a hard requirement for installing ``geoplot``
on all platforms - ``pip`` alone can't do it.


Linux
-----

If you haven't already, `install conda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/>`_.  You'll also need to have the
``conda-forge`` channel enabled: if you don't already, you can do so with ``conda config --add channels conda-forge``.

Then run ``conda install geoplot`` and you're done.

Mac OSX
-------

If you haven't already, `install conda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/>`_.  You'll also need to have the
``conda-forge`` channel enabled: if you don't already, you can do so with ``conda config --add channels conda-forge``.

Then run ``conda install geoplot`` and you're done.

Windows
-------

Unforunately ``geoplot`` is not available on Windows yet due to `a irresolvable dependency issue <https://github.com/SciTools/cartopy/issues/805>`.
Sorry.

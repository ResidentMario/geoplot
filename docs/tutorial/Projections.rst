Working with Projections
------------------------

`Projections <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection>`__ are
``geoplot``'s killer feature.

Our explaination is by example. Throughout this segment of the tutorial
we'll use the ``polyplot`` plot type, which faithfully displays whatever
geometry put into it.

.. code:: python

    import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '../../')  # ignore this
    import geopandas as gpd
    import geoplot as gplt
    %matplotlib inline
    
    usa = gpd.read_file("../../data/united_states/usa.geojson")
    usa = usa[~usa['adm1_code'].isin(['USA-3517', 'USA-3563'])]
    
    
    gplt.polyplot(usa).set_aspect("equal")

This map is an example of an **unprojected plot**: it faithfully
reproduces exact latitude and longitudes as Cartesian coordinates on a
plane.

But remember, the Earth is not a flat surface; it's a sphere. This isn't
a map of the United States that you'd seen in print anywhere because it
badly distorts both of the `two
criteria <http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/lectures/lec6concepts/Map%20coordinate%20systems/How%20to%20choose%20a%20projection.htm>`__
most projections are evaluated on: *shape* and *area*.

``geoplot`` can render both projected and unprojected plots.

Unprojected plots do have their uses, however. Most immediately, for
sufficiently small areas, the amount of distortion is very small. This
map of New York City, for example, is reasonably accurate:

.. code:: python

    boroughs = gpd.read_file("../../data/nyc_boroughs/boroughs.geojson")
    
    gplt.polyplot(boroughs)




.. parsed-literal::

.. image:: ../../scripts/Projections_files/../../scripts/Projections_3_1.png


More consequentially, ``geoplot`` returns unprojected plots as pure
``matplotlib`` ``AxesSubplot`` objects, while projected plots, which
require heavy-lifting in the form of coordinate transformations, are
returned as ``cartopy`` ``GeoAxesSubplot`` objects.

To understand why this matters, let's first take a look at how we
generate projected plots, and what they look like.

In the case of the contiguous United States, the projection most often
used is known as the `Albers equal area
projection <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albers_projection>`__. This
projection works by wrapping the Earth around a cone, one that's
particularly well optimized for locations near the middle of the
Northern Hemisphere (and particularly poorly for locations at the
poles). Here's what the world looks like in this projection:

.. code:: python

    from IPython.display import Image
    Image("./figures/albers-equal-area-world.jpg")




.. image:: ../../scripts/Projections_files/../../scripts/Projections_5_0.jpg



To place our plot in a projection, we need to pass the projection of
interest to the ``projection`` keyword parameter. ``geoplot`` functions
expect input to come from the ``geoplot.crs`` module, imported as
``ccrs`` by convention.

.. code:: python

    import geoplot.crs as ccrs
    
    # ax = gplt.polyplot(usa, projection=ccrs.AlbersEqualArea()).set_ylim((-1597757.3894385984, 1457718.4893930717)); pass
    gplt.polyplot(usa, projection=ccrs.AlbersEqualArea())

.. image:: ../../scripts/Projections_files/../../scripts/Projections_7_1.png


.. code:: python

    ax.get_ylim()




.. parsed-literal::

    (-990405.63456327142, 1710695.8163137436)



``geoplot`` projections are actually a very thin wrapper on
``cartopy.crs`` projections, and every ``cartopy`` projection is
implemented in ``geoplot.crs``. Refer to `this
page <http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/crs/projections.html>`__
to see the list of projections that ``geoplot`` implements.

.. raw:: html

   <!--
   You may be wondering, if ``geoplot.crs`` is a wrapper on ``cartopy.crs``, why not just use Cartopy CRS objects directly? This comes down to an important implementation detail: when Cartopy CRS objects are used as the library  intends for them to be used, projection geolocation settings are supposed to be defined as parameters to the projection and cannot be modified after instantiation. This means that if you don't explicitly specify otherwise yourself, a Cartopy CRS object will result in a map centered on mid-Africa&mdash;coordinate `(0, 0)`!</p>

   ``geoplot`` avoids forcing this extra work on the user by computing sensible defaults, based on the data provided, when exact settings are not provided. This is why the plot above "just works": ``geoplot`` computed the mean centroid of the polygons and centered the plot on that coordinate in the background. This feature comes at the cost of a little bit of awkwardness, requiring our wrapper classes, but overall the tradeoff seems to be very "worth it".</p>
   -->

At this time, the defaults are still a work in progress, however. If you
look closely at this figure you'll notice that our copy of the United
States is ever so slightly skewed downwards and to the right, indicating
that the default settings ``geoplot`` calculates for us are off. We can
correct this by specifying center coordinates ourselves.

The `center of the contiguous United
States <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_center_of_the_contiguous_United_States>`__
is 39°50′N 98°35′W. If we provide approximately these coordinates as
``central_latitude`` and ``central_longitude`` coordinates to our
projection, our skew is fixed!

.. code:: python

    gplt.polyplot(usa, projection=ccrs.AlbersEqualArea(central_longitude=-98, central_latitude=39.5))

A not cut-off (again, work in progress—you can fix this issue by
specifying
``ax = plt.gca(); ax.set_ylim((-1597757.3894385984, 1457718.4893930717))``)
version of this is the version of the map of the United States that
you're probably most familiar with.

Of course, why stop there? I encourage you to experiment with some of
the crazier projections (like ``Gnomonic``) that ``cartopy`` provides.
Of particular value are global projections, which provide a way of
visualizing your data on top of an actual for-real sphere—neat! A
demonstrative exame is provided below.

.. code:: python

    ax = gplt.polyplot(usa, projection=ccrs.Orthographic())
    ax.set_global()
    ax.gridlines()
    ax.stock_img()

The gallery has an `example <../../examples/los-angeles-flights.html>`__
that further demonstrates these globes and the things you can do with
them.

Now, back to where we left off earlier re: projected versus unprojected
plots. Recall that ``geoplot`` returns unprojected plots as pure
``matplotlib`` ``AxesSubplot`` objects, while projected plots are
returned as ``cartopy`` ``GeoAxesSubplot`` objects.

But ``cartopy`` ``GeoAxesSublot`` objects cannot be colocated with
``matplotlib`` ``AxesSubplot`` objects, nor vice versa!

Once you have a graph, you're stuck in whatever "ecosystem" you chose to
be in at runtime. This is the major reason why we even bother providing
an option to get "inferior-looking" ``AxesSubplot`` output at all:
because it can integrated with other "stuff" in the wider ``matplotlib``
ecosystem.

The biggest such win, in my opinion, is ``mplleaflet``, a small library
which allows you to place ``matplotlib`` plots on an interactive
`Leaflet <http://leafletjs.com/>`__ webmap.

And while ``cartopy`` projected plots are almost universially
better-looking on their own, most of the tools out there are
``matplotlib``-based. This is super handy, and looks something like
this:

.. code:: python

    # Code:
    # import mplleaflet
    # gplt.polyplot(boroughs)
    # mplleaflet.display()
    
    # Result:
    Image("./figures/leaflet-webmap-example.png")

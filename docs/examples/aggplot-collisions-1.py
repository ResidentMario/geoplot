# In the first plot we do not provide any geographic data at all as input. In this case aggplot takes the centroids
# of whatever it is that we are throwing at it and uses them to decompose the boundaries of our data into squares,
# with a cetain user specified minimum (nmin) and maximum (nmax) number of observations per square. This is known in
# the literature as a QuadTree. An additional parameter, nsig, controls how many observations have to be made in a
# square for that square to be considered significant (insignificant and empty squares are not colored in). The agg
# parameter controls the method by which the observations are aggregated---in the default case np.mean is used,
# in this case we have specified a maximum (np.max) instead.

# dataset corresponding with sort of encoded geography---in this example, the postal zip code. Aggplot computes the

.. _installing:

Installation
============

Linux and Mac OSX
-----------------

If you haven't already, `install conda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/>`_. Then run
``conda install geoplot -c conda-forge`` and you're done.

Windows
-------

Unforunately ``geoplot`` is not available on Windows yet due to `an unresolved dependency issue <https://github.com/SciTools/cartopy/issues/805>`_.
Sorry.

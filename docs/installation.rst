============
Installation
============

``geoplot`` is Python 3.6+ only.

With Conda (Recommended)
------------------------

If you haven't already, `install conda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/>`_. Then run
``conda install geoplot -c conda-forge`` and you're done. This works on all platforms (Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows).

Without Conda
-------------

You can install ``geoplot`` using ``pip install geoplot``. Use caution however, as this probably will not work on
Windows, and possibly will not work on OSX and Linux.

Voronoi of Melbourne primary schools
====================================

This example shows a ``pointplot`` combined with a ``voronoi`` mapping primary schools in
Melbourne. Schools in outlying, less densely populated areas serve larger zones than those in
central Melbourne.

This example inspired by the `Melbourne Schools Zones Webmap <http://melbourneschoolzones.com/>`_.
